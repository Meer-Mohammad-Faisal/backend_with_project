 why we can't store password in plain directly...

 then we should enctypt and decrypt the password by using key?

 what happen if our is also hacked?

 then we have to desing such a algo in which we only encrypt not decrypt

now hashing come into the picture. 

will hashing also hacked by the hacker? and what is rainbow table?


now salting come into the picture

should i use the same salt for all the users?

i have to use diffrent salt for diffrent users

so, the password will be in the form of hash form and add the salt(int plain text).
