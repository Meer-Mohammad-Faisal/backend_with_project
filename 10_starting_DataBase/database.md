what is database?
what is dbms?
how excel is not bdms?


structured data?
unstructured data? video is a unstructured data beacuse we can  not run any query on video
semi-structured data?

why we cannot push video in database(locals)? bcz its size is larger:-- and it transfer the data from secodry memory to primary memory the process but it size is larger and ram(primary memory can't hadle this)so, it is called unstructured data. and we can not run any queries on it.

so video is semi-sturctured data; they consist:-> metadata(structured) + actual data(unstructured-data);

so we can only store meta data in table like their length.., we can run query eassly now
