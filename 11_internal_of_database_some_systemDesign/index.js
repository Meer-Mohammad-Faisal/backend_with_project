// UNDERSTANDING DISADVANTAGE OF SQL?

// we can not insert very large data in sql eg:- insta account of 10 crore user and their 1000 crore posts


// Normalization in DBMS

// ADVANTAGE OF MONGO-DB OVER RDBMS: no need for joins, no need for data normalization,...

// MONGODB(no - sql) means not only sql

// sql only do vertical scalling, can't do horizontal scaling
// but mongo db can do both horizontal and vertically scal.

// what is sharding?

// replica?(distributed database)
// load balancer?

// challenge in distributed like synchronize? and etc...

// CAP THEORM?
